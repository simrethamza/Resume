<h1>Why are you interested in programming?</h1>
<p>
Back when I was a high school senior, I was curious how one can put a set of instruction in the computer to perform several tasks in a short period of time accurately. After high school, my programming passion made me to join the department of computer science at the university of Arbaminch. That is where I started the long journey of programming.  The program covers several courses, for example, advanced mathematics courses, programing courses such as C#, C++, Java, and SQL server. </p>
<p>Now days regardless of sophisticated technologies, the amount of information and available problems, I think, requires wise analytical and problem solving skills to answer organization or individual problem. Such challenges make me to continue think and be passionate in programming. </p>

<h1>What have you done to expose yourself to programming?</h1>
<p>
When I first heard about Microsoft LEAP program from a Software Engineer friend, I started searching the web to learn more about the content of the program. I am impressed by Mr. William Adamâ€™s short video and vision, and the full breadth of real world and class room experience one can acquire within 16 weeks. The program, I believe, is a great opportunity to integrate and succeed in Software Engineering for a person like myself with a computer science background and international work experience. Currently I am a permanent resident of Seattle, WA.</p>
<p>During my college study in computer science and after my graduation, I have had formal training in advanced mathematics and several programming courses including C#, C++, Java, SQL server 2012, SQL Server Integration Services 2010, SQL Server Reporting Services, SQL Server Analysis Services, and Visual Studio 2012/13. </p>
<p>Immediately after acquiring my computer science degree, I started my professional career in software development, in RAMA construction, Ethiopia. It was a challenge to bring together all the requests from civil Engineers and management team to formulate the problem and provide a creative solution. With strong collaborative spirit and clear communication with colleagues who had no programming skill, the one year project was successfully completed and made me passionate in Software Engineering career. The following years, I spent most of my time on SQL development and other administrative assignments. 
I believe Microsoft LEAP software Engineer apprenticeships program together with my technical and analytical skills bring my software Engineering career dream a reality.</p>
